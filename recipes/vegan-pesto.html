    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Pesto is a sauce that is believed to have originated in the Liguria region of northwestern Italy. It’s thought that it may have evolved from a 13th century garlic-based sauce called aggiadda or from the tradition of using aromatic herbs in the Middle Ages.</p>
    <p>The first written recipe for pesto was from Giovanni Battista Ratto in his 19th century work The Genoese cuisine. This recipe was a mix of garlic, basil, and cheese</p>
    <p>Our plant-based version skips the cheese, but is similarly packed with basil and full of flavor.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups packed fresh basil (large stems removed)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp pine nuts or walnuts (if nut-free, try sunflower seeds!)</li>
            <li>3 large cloves garlic (peeled)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>3-4 Tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp sea salt (plus more to taste)</li>
            <li>2-3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil*</li>
            <li>3-6 Tbsp water (plus more as needed)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To a food processor or small blender, add the basil, nuts, garlic, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt and blend/mix on high until a loose paste forms.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil a little at a time (streaming in while the machine is on if possible) and scrape down sides as needed. Then add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) water at a time until the desired consistency is reached – a thick but pourable sauce. (If avoiding oil altogether, sub the oil with vegetable broth or just use all water.)</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor, salt for overall flavor, nuts for nuttiness, garlic for bite / zing, or lemon juice for acidity.</li>
            <li>Perfect for adding to sauces, dressings, breads, and more! My favorite recently has been adding it straight to zucchini or carrot noodles (see photo) for a beautiful, healthy side dish</li>
            <li>Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week. After that, pour into ice cube molds, freeze, and store up to 1 month or more.
